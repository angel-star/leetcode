'''

Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

Hint:

A naive implementation of the above process is trivial. Could you come up with other methods? Show More Hint

经过试验 发现它是循环的  0123456789……………………但是直接向下面这样写的话是不可以的   因为在python中-1%9是8    （=。=好傻啊）
 return 1 + (num - 1) % 9
 
 但是如果要是用循环来做的话  怎么做呢？？？
